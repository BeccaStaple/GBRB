A word has been selected at random - can you guess it in 10? How about 7?

+ Inform your guesses by finding patterns
+ You have 10 shots to guess the 4-letter word (only 7 shots on hard mode)
+ Try to maintain your streak!

The hardest part of this game is not screaming at the game when you loose (especially when you were so close!)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A mind game where the person has to guess the word generated by the computer.


The app is published in play store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moh.theamazingappco.bricks

Note: The build version of this app is outdated because i cant update it on my PC due to space constraints, i will soon update the sdk version.
Also please dont raise pull request to FinalBranch.. take from the master branch.

Issues I need help with:

1) A nice splash screen to go with the game. --DONE-- Thanks to https://github.com/raghavtalwar7
2) Logo for the game might need some improvement. --DONE-- Thanks to https://github.com/arsundram
3) The general UI changes that can be made, I am happy to accept.
4) The UI for lobby activity can be improved a lot.
5) Update readme.md which will also be displayed on the app store under app description
